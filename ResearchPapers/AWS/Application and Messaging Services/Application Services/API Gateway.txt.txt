API Gateway:
----------------------------

API Gateway is a fully managed service provided by AWS.

You can use this service to provide REST API's to your clients. You cannot write your business logic in API gateway, the busness
logic needs to be written in a Lambda function, an EC2 instance or an on-premise server and API Gateway can be used
to translate the response of business logic in REST format.

API GAteway cache:
---------------------
The API responses can also be cached for certain period of time to reduce number of hits to backend servers. Can be seen as varnish cache.
