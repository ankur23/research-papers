Simple Notification Service:
-------------------------------------

SNS provides a way to send Notifications within and outside AWS environment.

SNS consists of a three main components:
1. Publisher: One who send message/notification. This can be a Human, S3 event, CloudWatch Alarm, DynamoDB etc.
2. Subscriber: One who receives notification/message. This can be Email, SMS, SQS, lambda, an HTTP endpoint etc.
3. Topic: When a Publisher sends a message, it does not directly sends it to subcriber but it sends it to a Topic.
          And any subcribers that have subscribed to that topic receives the message.

             message               message
 Publisher ------------->   Topic -----------> Subscriber1, Subscriber2


SNS can be easily integrated with CLoudwatch to setup a full-environment monitoring solution, that notifies Administrators
of capacity Issues, downtime etc.
