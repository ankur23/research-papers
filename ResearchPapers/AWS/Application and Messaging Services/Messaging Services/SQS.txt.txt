Simple Queue Service:
---------------------------------

SQS is a messaging Queue provided by AWS. Can be seens as an alternative for RabbitMQ.
The Queues are fully managed and distributed.

Messages can be pushed to SQS by using an Http endpointand can be retrieved by using an Http endpoint through POLLING.
NOTE: SQS does not push messages to worker, worker needs to poll messages from SQS.

NOTE: When polling, Since the queue is distributed SQS needs to search multiple servers for messages.

NOTE: A message cannot be of more than 256KB in size.!!BEWARE

Types of Queue:

1. Standard Queue: Each message is delivered atleast once, but does not guarantee the order in which messages will be delivered.
2. FIFO: Each message is delivered only once and in First come First served fashion.


There can be two types of polling:
1. Short Polling: In this SQS searches only a subset of servers for messages and can return with 0 or less than demanded messages.
2. Long Polling: SQS searches in all servers for the messages and wait for (1-20) seconds if no message is present in the queue before returning empty handed.
