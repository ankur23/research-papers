Users:
These users can login into AWS console and perform actions based on the access (policies) provided to them.

Groups: 
A group consists of one or more users. 
Access rights can be attached directly to a group and it will be applicable to all the users belonging to that group.

Policies: 
These are access rights which can be assigned to a user, group or role.

Roles: 
Roles comes in picture, when an AWS service needs to access another AWS service. 
Suppose, an EC2 instance wants to access a S3 bucket. In such a scenario, we need to provide correct access rights to EC2 instance so it can 
access S3 bucket. However, access rights (policies) cannot be directly assigned to a service, the solution is to assign the access rights (policies) to something called 
Role and then this Role is attached to the service.

Roles are just like groups, the difference is that they get assigned to a AWS service (like EC2) instead of users.
