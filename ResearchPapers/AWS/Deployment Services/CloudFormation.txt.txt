CloudFormation:
-------------------------

Cloudformation allows you to deploy your INFRASTRUCTURE and a CODE. 

You can basically specify your applications architecture in a Json file and cloudformation will provision the resources as necessary by reading the JSON file
as specified by you.

Benefits:
---------------
- Since your infrastructure is now just a code, you can easily define several verions of it.
- Saves time as most of the repeated tasks are automated to CloudFormation.
- Easy backups of your infrastructure, as it is just a json file.
