Routing Table:

A routing table consists of set of rules called routes. These rules are used to determine how a network packet is to be routed.

Note: The default VPC already has "main" route table.

Note:
  -> unlike a IGW, a VPC can have multiple route tables attached.
  -> A route table cannot be deleted if it has any subnet associated to it.
