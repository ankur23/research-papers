1.
a. Create a VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
b. Create an Internet gateway and attach it to VPC.
c. Create two route tables, One we will use with Private subnets and another with public subnets.
   [If a subnet does not have route to Internet its called private.]
d. Create following subnets:
     Subnet1(public) : 10.0.1.0/24 
     Subnet2(public) : 10.0.2.0/24
     Subnet3(private): 10.0.3.0/24
     Subnet4(private): 10.0.4.0/24  
   
   Associate public subnets to public route table to truly make them public.
   Associate private subnets to private route table to truly make them private.

e. Now, Create 2 NACLS one for each AZ.
   Can a NACL expand over multiple AZ? YES :)
f. NACL 1 should allow HTTP traffic as well as SSH traffic.
   [OUTBOUND SSH traffic can take any ephemeral port so need to allow ephemeral ports too.]
   NACL 2 should allow HTTP, SSH traffic as well as RDP (used by RDS) traffic
g. Assign NACL 1 to subnet1 and 3.
h. Assign NACL 2 to subnet 2 and 4.   

i. Create 4 security groups, Allow HTTP and SSH traffic on it.
