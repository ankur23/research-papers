Internet Gateway:

An internet gateway is a combination of harware plus software which provides your network access to internet.

Note: IGW is horizontally scaled so it imposes no bandwidth constraint, it is as well redundant and higly available so it imposes no availability risks.

Note:
 -> Only 1 Internet gateway can be attached to a VPC at a given time.
 -> An internet gateway cannot be detached from a VPC, while there are active AWS resources in the VPC(such as EC2 or RDS).
