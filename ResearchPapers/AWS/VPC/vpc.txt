Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):

As the name sugests, it is a private cloud inside AWS's mega cloud, which is dedicated only to you. 

The term `virtual` means that the seperation/isolation from other private clouds is only at software level and not hardware based.

You can create your own virtual network inside a VPC and you will have full controll over it.
Like: creation of subnets, confiuration of routing tables and network gateways.  



At a very basic level, VPC can be conceptualized as a private HOME Network. Any home network that talks to internet has following components:

1. Modem.    : Provides gateway to internet.
2. Router.   : Provides communication between home devices and also routes traffic to external devices through modem.
3. Firewall  : controls the incoming and outgoing traffic from computers.
4. Computers : end Receiver or sender of traffic.

Comparing the components of a home network with the components of a VPC, we can see how similar both are:

      VPC                                        Home network

  Internet Gateway                                  Modem
  Route Table                                       Router
  Network ACL                                       Firewall
  EC2 Instance                                      Computers

NOTE: When you create a AWS account a defaul VPC is created for you. Including components which are required to make it functional:
      1. Internet Gateway (IGW) to talk to internet
      2. A Route table with predefined routes to default subnets.
      3. A network access control list.
      4. Subnets.
