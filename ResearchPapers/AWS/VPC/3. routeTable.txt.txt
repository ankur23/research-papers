Routing Table:

A routing table consists of set of rules called routes. These rules are used to determine how a network packet is to be routed.

Note: The default VPC already has "main" route table.

Note:
  -> unlike an IGW, a VPC can have multiple route tables attached at any given point of time.
  -> A route table cannot be deleted if it has any subnet associated to it.

A route table's route comprised of two main components:
1. Destination: This is the CIDR block range of the target where the data is to be routed.
2. Target: This is the name of the target where data is to be routed.

Destination                  Target
 172.31.0.0./16             local
 0.0.0.0/0                  igw-5t65r4e3

A route to Internet Gateway needs to be attached to Route Table, incase that route table needs to route traffic to internet.
By default all route tables have route to communicate internally between instances inside a VPC or other route tables. This is the local route as in above example.



Best Practice:
---------------
Best Practice is to not to modify default route tables and create a new route table incase you want new routes for your subnet.
