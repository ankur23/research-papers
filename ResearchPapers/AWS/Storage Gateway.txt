Storage gateway:
-----------------------

1. What are typical usecases of storage gateway?
   - Backup and archiving.
   - Disaster recovery
   - Moving data to S3

2. How Many types of Storage Interfaces are provided by Storage gateway?
   - Storage Gateway provides 3 types of interfaces:
      a: File gateway Interface
      b: Volume gateway Interface
      c: Virtual gateway Tape Interface.

3. What is a File Gateway Interface?
   - File gateway allows your existing applications to use "cloud storage" without any modifications.
     File gateway makes your S3 buckets mountable as NFS mount points.
     Any data written to these mount point is transferred to S3 bucket.   

4. What is Volume gateway?
  - Volume gateway also allows your application to use cloud storage but it makes use of iSCSI
    (internet small computer systems interface)

5. What sort of encryption does storage gatway provides?
  - All data transferred b/w Gateway and AWS is transfeered over SSL.

File gateway:
--------------

6. What protocols are supported by File gateway?
   - NFS v3 and NFS v4.1

7. How does file gateway access my S3 bucket?
   - File Gateway uses IAM role to access S3 bucket.

8. How does my application access FIle gateway?
  - You need to mount file gateway to the on-premise server.

9. What is the relationship b/w files on on-premise server and objects on S3?
  - Files and objects share a one to one relationship i.e for each file one object is ceated in S3.
  - The value of the object is file's content.
  - the key/name of object is the path of file.ex: dir1/file.html

10. Can I create symbolic links in file gateway?
  - NO. Symbolic and hard links are not supported.

11. S3 does not provide ability to rename an object, how is this managed when I will rename a file?
  - In such a case, old objects data is copied to the object with new name and then the old object is deleted.

12. How do I set content-type for files uploaded to S3?
  - File gateway can guess the MIME types of files based on their extensions and can use it to set contenttype for object
    in s3.

13. can I have multiple reader and writers using different file Gateway to access same S3 bucket?
   - Multiple Readers can read from a single S3 bucket without any issues.
   - Multiple writers can write to the same bucket but this may cause data corruption as one writer can
      overwrite the changes of another one since both are managed by different gateways.

14. How will I know, when my file is uploaded to S3?
   - When you write files to file share, its first stored in the local cache of the gateway and is then written
     asynchronously to the S3 bucket.
     You can configure cloudwatch alerts to notify you of the S3 object creation.

15. How large of a file can I store using file gateway?
   - File gateway supports max file size of 5TB. Which is the max allowed size by S3.

16. Can I use Versioning, life-cycle policies, cross-region replication, S3 events with file gateway?
   - YES.

17. Can I use storage gateway to read and write files to S3 Glacier?
   - You can use Bucket lifecycle policies to store files in Glacier.
   - However, reading a file stored in glacier using file gateway will generate an IO error.

18. Can I use file gateway to write files to EFS?
   - NO. File Gateway can only be used to write files to S3.

19. How should I decide which one to use File Gateway or S3 API?
   - You should Use File gateway, when you want to use Objects in s3 as regular files and need to perform
     file related activities on them.
   - You should use S3 API, when your application does not need to treat S3 objects as files.

20. How does File gateway manage its cache?
   - File gateway stores the data to be written to AWS in locak disk cache.
   - It also keeps the frequently accessed data in disk cache, to provide faster reads.
   Data is evicted from disk cache only when space is needed to accomodate more recently used data.

Volume Gateway:
------------------

21. Can I access te volume data stored in S3 using S3 API's?
   - NO. You need to use volume gateway.

22. How Can I create a EBS volume based on the data stored in Volume Gateway?
   - For this, you can take a snapshot of the volume gateway and use this snapshot as the basis of EBS volume.

23. Can I use a EBS snapshot as the starting point of my Storage Gateway?
   - YES. you can start a new storage gateway using a SNAPSHOT.

24. Do I need to unmount storage Gateway volume before taking a snapshot?
  - NO.

25. Does the read/write performance be degraded till the time snapshot is in progress?
   - NO.

26. Can I schedule time of snapshots?
   - YES.

27. How long does it takes to complete a snapshot?
   - The time dependent on the size of volume and internet speed.
   - AWS compresses data for snapshot before sending to AWS.

28. can I access my snapshots from the S3 API?
   - NO. Snapshots are accessible only from EBS API and Storage gateway.         

------------------


1. What is the difference b/w file gateway and volume gateway?
   - In both the case data is stored in S3.
     BUT, File gateway's data can be accessed using S3 API's
     However, Volume Gateways data can only be accessed using EBS API's and not S3 API's.
   - Volume gateways perform compression before sending data to AWS.
     File gateways do not perform any such compression.

2. Can I use AWS Direct connect with Storage Gateway?
   - YES.

3. Can I use CloudWatch for monitoring gateway cache performance?
   - YES.
