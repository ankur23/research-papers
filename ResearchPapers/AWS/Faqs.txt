#General FAQ's
-----------------

1. RDS: Can A Read replica be promoted to Master?
  - YES.

2. Can I have Reserved RDS instances as like Reserved EC2 Instances?
  - YES.  

3. Can I send Push Notifications to IOS and Android using SNS?
  - YES.

4. How Long can a SWF workflow/task last?  
  - A SWF workflow and task can last for 1 year. 

5. Can I scan Ports on EC2 machines?
  - PORT SCANNING on EC2 machines is disabled and requires AWS permissions to do so. 

6. Can I use Elastic IP created in one region in another region?
  - Elastic IP can be used in one specific VPC only. 

7. Can I migrate my Reserved Instance to another AZ?
  - YES.

8. Can a SWF workflow incluse tasks to be performed by On-Premise servers?
  - SWF workflow can include tasks to be performed by on-premise servers and humans. 

9. What is the best place to locate HSM appliance for an application? 
  - HSM appliance should be located near EC2 machines to reduce cost. 

10. What is origin Access Identity?
    - A special user assiged to Cloudfront that has access to S3 objects.

11. Do we need to explicitely attach IGW to vpc or simply setting route to IGW is fine.
    - YES. This is absolutely necessary. Simply setting the route to IGW will send all data to BLACKHOLE, if the IGW is not
    attached to a VPC.   

12. Can Reserved Instances be migrated to different Region?
   - NO. Reserved instances can be moved between availability zones of same region. But, they cannot be moved to other Region.

13. Can we modify Instance Type of Reserved Instance?
   - YES. Convertible Reserved Instances allow you to modify instance type of the Reserved Instances.

14. Difference b/w EC2 termination and EC2 Stop and EC2 Shutdown.
    - These 2 features are very very similar to each other, with only certain notable differences.
       - EC2 Stop option is only available for instances which have EBS volume as its root volume.
       - Stopping an EC2 does not delete the EBS volumes attached to the instance. However, termination provides this option.
    - NOTE that both options completely deletes the virtual machine assigned to you.

#EBS FAQ's
----------------
1. Can EBS volumes be transferred to different AZ and Region?
    - EBS volumes are specific to a availability zone. i.e an EBS volume existing in availability zone A can only be assigned to 
      a EC2 instance residing on the same availability zone.
      In case, you want to assign the EBS volume to an EC2 running in different AZ, you first need to create a 
      snapshot of the EBS volume. Then from that snapshot you need to create a new EBS volume which resides in the required AZ.

      Incase, you want to assign the EBS volume to an EC2 residing in entirely different region.
      You need to create a snapshot of the EBS volume, then the snapshot can be copied to the required region.
      Then from that snapshot you need to create a new EBS volume and assign it to the required EC2.


2. Can a EBS volume be detached from one running EC2 instance and attached to another.
   - NO. If its a root volume of the EC2 instance it cannot be detached.
   - YES. If its not a root volume for the EC2 instance.


#EMR FAQ's
-----------------             
1. What will happen incase a EMR cluster is terminated?
      - All the provisioned EC2 nodes master/slave for the cluster will be terminated.
      - All the cluster data stored in S3 will be deleted.

2. Do I need to manually terminate the EMR cluster?
     - No. The cluster and all its resources are automatically destroyed once jobs finish processing.
     However, you can choose to not to do so and then you will need to manually terminate cluster.              

3. Do EMR cluster nodes makes use of multi-AZ?
    - No. All the nodes in a cluster is launched in single AZ.

4. Can my EMR recover if master/slave node is down?
   - No. Incase the master node is down, AWS cannot recover it for you. You need to manually restart it.
   - But if only the slave node is down it can automatically fix it.

5. Can I SSH into my EMR nodes?
   - You can SSH into Master node directly. For Slave nodes, you first need to SSH into master and then in Slave.

6. EMR: Can I modify number of Slave Nodes in a Running CLuster?
   - There are two types of slave nodes:
       Core Nodes: These execute JObs as well as store data in HDFS.
       Task Nodes: These only execute jobs.
   - Core Nodes can only be increased. Task Nodes can be increased as well as decreased.

#API Gateway:
-----------------------
1. Can I use HTTPS endpoints ?
   - You will be surprised to know that, API Gateway only supports HTTPS endpoints and does not support unencrypted HTTP endpoints.

2. Can I use authorization with API's created in API Gateway?
   - YES. You can either use "AWS signature version 4" or can use custom authorizer.

3. How does "Aws signature version 4" work ?
  - IN this, each request sent to API gateway is signed with the ACCESS ID and ACCESS KEY. This ID and Key can be of specific
  user which has access to API gateway through IAM policies.

4. How does "Custom Authorization" work ?
  - For Custom Authorization, Lambda functions are used.
  - API gateway checks upon receiving request that a custom authorizer is configured or not. If its configured, it 
    send the request to Lambda function to authorize the request.

5. If my Backend service is running on EC2, will the API Gateway make private calls to my Backend Service ?
  - API Gateway never makes a Private call to backend service, no matter whether your service is running within a VPC or outside of it.
  - IT Always make Public calls. Thus, your backend service must have Public endpoints exposed.

6. How will I ensure that the Requests made to my backend are from API gateway ?
  - API gateway generates a SSL certificate and make the Public key of the certificate avilable to you.
    You can use this Public key to verify that the request has originated from API gateway.  

7. I know API gateway provides caching option, but can I Invalidate cache manually?
  - YES. API gateway exposes endpoints to invalidate cache, even for specific resources.

#CloudFormation:
---------------------------
1. Can I use ELasticBeanstalk inside of Cloudformation template?
  - YES.

2. What will happen incase Cloudformation fails to create a certain resource. WIll I be left in a unstable state?
  - NO. All the created resources upto the point will be DELETED.

3. Can I create a entirely new VPC from cloudformation template?  
  - YES.

#ELasticBeanstalk:
-----------------------------
Nothing

#LAMBDA:
------------------------------
1. Where is the AWS lambda code stored?
  - Lambda code is stored in S3.

2. Can I use child threads and processes in lamda function?
   - YES. Almost all the OS specific features are available.

3. My Lambda needs to access and store some data. Can I do that?
   - YES. You can use webservices to do that.
   - S3, Dynamo all provide access to data through web service.

4. What are some restrictions applied on Lambda?
   - Lambda's do not accept any Inbound Connections.
   - Only TCP/IP Outbound connections are supported.
   - PORT 25 is blocked.

5. Can I use Environment variables with Lambda?
   - YES. you can access as well modify them.

6. How do I allocate resources to Lambda function?
   - You can only chose the Amount of Memory required by your code to execute.
   - Rest all the resources are automatically allotted based on the Memory size chosen.

7. Will my Lambda function execute infinitely, if I write a never ending loop?
   - NO.
   - Max. time for execution is 300 Seconds.
   - Default is 3 Seconds.

8. How can I invoke a Lambda function using HTTPS?
   - For this you make use of API gateway.
   - API Gateway will provide you a HTTPS endpoint, which can execute lambda function.

9. what will happen if my lambda code crashes when responding to an event.
   - The code is retried thrice.

10. What if it crashes even after retries?
   - In such case, you can configure a "Dead Letter Queue".
   - Events that gets failed even after retries will be put in this queue. This Can be a SQS queue or a SNS topic.
   - If the Queue is not configured, event is discarded.       

11. How do I access S3 object in my Lambda?
  - To access AWS resources permissions needs to be granted using IAM.
  - In this case, you need to create an IAM role that has access to the required S3 bucket.
    Then, Lambda can assume that role in order to access S3 objects.

12. Can I access my RDS sitting in private subnet from lambda function?
  - Well, Lambda functions cannot access VPC resources through their private IP's. By default. But you can Enable this configuration.
  - Enabling the configuration requires that you chose proper Subnet and Security Group for your Lambda as well.
  - The tradeoff it brings is that, Lambda will not be able to access Open Internet as like before.
  - If it needs to access open internet like before, you will need to Set Up NAT for it.

13. Can My Lambda Access resources from two different VPC's?
   - NO. It will only be able to access the resources of VPC you chose to place lambda in.

14. Can I chose the OS on which lambda is to be run?
   - YES.   

#VPC:
---------

1. What is a VPC endpoint?
   - Provides private connection to services hosted in AWS, from inside of a VPC without using IGW, NAT, VPN etc.
   - Can be used to connect privately to ELB, S3, DynamoDB.

2. Can a EC2 sitting in public subnet, but not having public IP access internet without NAT or VPG?
   - Need to check.

3. How can EC2 access internet using VPN/VPG?
    - The EC2 can route internet traffic to VPG, which can further route it to datacenter. From there it can access Internet.

4. What is the difference b/w hardware and software VPN connection?
   - The software VPN makes use of Internet Gateway for the connection.
   - Hardware VPN makes use of VPG instead.

5. What is the maximum throughput of a VPN connection?
   - 1.25 Gbps (when using VPG) 
   - If you are using multiple VPN connections to the same VPC. Then this is the combined limit.

6. What IP address do I need to use for Customer gateway(CGW)?
   - The Public IP address of the NAT device.              

7. What is the CIDR block range assigned to default VPC?
   - 172.31.0.0/16

8. Max no. of hosts allowed by AWS?
   - /16 = 2 ^ 16 = 65536

9. Min no. of hosts allowed in VPC?
   - /28 = 2^4 = 16

10. Max number of subnets inside a VPC?
   - 200

11. Can I use all IP addresses from CIDR block range of subnet as host addresses?          
   - NO. First 4 and last 1 IP is reserved by AWS.

12. Can I assign multiple private IPs to an EC2 instance?
   - YES.

13. Can I change the private IP address of the running EC2?
   -  You cannot change the primary private IP of EC2 till the lifespan of the EC2.
   -  You can remove and attach secondary private IPs whenever you want.

14. Can I attach the Ip address of a stopped EC2 to another EC2?
   - NO. Ip address assigned to an EC2 can be used by another EC2 only when the previous one is terminated.

15. Can I assign multiple Elastic Ips to single EC2?
   - YES.
   - However, communication to Elastic IPs are done only over IGW and not VPN or NAT.

16. Does VPC support multicast or broadcast?
   - NO.

17. Can an EC2 in one region communicate with another EC2 in another Region?
   - YES. They can use following means of communication:
       - Can communicate through IGW.
       - NAT gateway/instances
       - VPN 
       - AWS Direct Connect.
       - Inter-region VPC peering.

18. What are the ways in which my EC2 can communicate with S3?
   - VPC Endpoints for private network access.
   - IGW for access over internet.
   - DIrect Connect
   - VPN

19. DOES AWS allows PING request?
   - FOR EC2 YES.
   - FOR Default gateway NO.

20. How many Default VPC's can I have?
   - You can have 1 default VPC per region.

21. Can I delete a default VPC or subnet?
   - YES. 

22. Can I attach or detach Network Interfaces to EC2 while its running?
   - YES.

23. Can I attach a Network Interface residing in one AZ to an EC2 running in another AZ?
   - NO. They can only be assigned to EC2 running in same AZ.    

24. Will I be charged for a Elastic IP that is attached to Network Interface but interface is not attached to any EC2?
   - YES.

25. Can I detach primary interface(eth0) from EC2?
   - NO. You can detach secondary interfaces but not primary.

26. Can two VPC's living in different regions be peered together?
   - YES.

27. Can VPC's residing in two different AWS accounts be peered?
   - YES.

28. Can I use VPN connection to access resources of the VPC I am peered with?
   - NO.

29. Does VPC peering require IGW?
   - NO.

30. Difference b/w same Region and inter-region VPC peering?
   - Traffic in Inter region peering is encrypted.
   - Inter-Region VPC does not support IPv6 addresses.
   - Network Load balancers, Elastic File System, AWS private link not supported in Inter-Region VPC.

31. What if my peering connection goes down, will AWS send data over internet?
   - It is High-Avaliable and reduntant network, so AWS says it cannot fail.
   - Even though if it fails data will not be transferred over internet.

32. If I peer VPC A to VPC B and I peer VPC B to VPC C, does that mean VPCs A and C are peered?   
   - NO. Transitive peering is not supported.

33. What is AWS Private link?
   - Private link is a way to Access AWS services which are not VPC specific such as S3, DynamoDB over the private network 
     provided by AWS.

34. How does Private Link work?
   - Firstly, you will need to create service endpoints for the service you wish to use over private link.
     A service Endpoint is a Elastic Network Address containing private IP for the service to be used.
     Any, traffic destined to this Private IP will be routed to corresponding Service over private link.

#RDS:
------------
1. Can I choose when a maintenance is to be performed on my Db Instance?
  - You can Schedule a Weekly maintenance window.

2. Why does my backup storage costs more than allotted Db iNstance store?
  - Backup's needs to be stored on different availability zone which requires geo-transfers.

3. Can I move RDS reserved instance from one Region or AZ to another?
  -  RI's are fixed to a single Region and cannot be moved.
  -  You can change the AZ as per your wish though.

4. Can a Read replica be a Reserved Instance?
  - YES.

5. Can I modify the Instance type of the Database Instance?
  - Yes, you can modify the Instance type of a running instance and the changes will be applied immediately.
  - The instance will Shutdown during this period.

6. Do I need to manually create database backups or are they automated?
  - RDS provides Automated Backups and this feature is enabled by default.

7. How long does the backups are retained?
  - Backup data is kept for 7 days and can be extended upto 35 days.
  - This period is called as retention period.

8. Can I turn off Automated backups?
  - Configuring Retention Period to ZERO days, turns off automated backups.

9. What is the difference b/w Automated backups and DB Snapshots?
  - Db Snapshot: is a point in time snapshot of the database instance (stored in S3). Using Snapshot one can restore Db Instance 
         to the point that snapshot was taken.
  - Automated Backup: It performs a snapshot of full database daily at a Scheduled backup window. Any updates made to database after the 
         time of snapshot are stored as transaction logs. 
         This allows you to restore your database to any point in time and not only to the point at which snapshot was taken.

10. What happens to these backups and snapshots, when the database Instance itself is deleted?
  - All the automated backups and snapshots are deleted as well.
  - Only manually created snapshots are retained. 

11. Can I encrypt connection b/w my application and RDS instance?
  - YES. RDS provides ssl support.

12. Can my standby RDS be provisioned in different Region than primary?
   - NO. They both needs to be in same Region but different AZ.

13. After failover my primary is in different AZ than my other resources. Should I be worried about latency?
   - NO. data transfer b/w AZ of same region is fast.

14. Can I create a Read-Replica in the Region different from the one of Primary and Standby Instances?
    - YES.

15. How many Read Replicas can I have?
    - 5 for MYsql and 15 for Aurora.

16. Can I create a Read replica from another read-replica?
   - Yes.

17. Can a Read-Replica only accept read connections?
   - Mostly. But you can configure them to allow for DDL statements, like index creation.

18. Can I promote a Read-Replica to primary?
   - YES.

19. Can I take a snapshots from a READ-REPLICA?
  - NO.

20. Will a Read-Replica is deleted automatically, if its source DB is deleted?
   - NO. The read replica will continue to respond to read requests.
   - One of the read-replica will be promoted to act as primary.

21. Is it mandatory to enable Automated Backup support in order to use Read-Replica feature?
   - YES.

#EBS:
-------------
1. Does the IO Size of my request affect the throughput I get from my EBS or HDD?
    - YES. Each IO is breaked into chunks of 256KB, so if the IO size increases more chunks are to be created and
       to user it will appear that less requests are processed.

2. Can I access the EBS snaphots stored in S3 using regular S3 API?
    - NO. you will need to use EC2 API for this.

3. Do I need to unmount a EBS volume before taking a snapshot?
    - NO. 
    - But as a best practice, you should detach the volume before taking the snapshot and then reattach it.
    - Incase its a root volume, shutdown the EC2 take snapshot and start it again.

4. Does a snapshot of 16TB Volume takes more time than that of 1 TB volume?
    - NO.
