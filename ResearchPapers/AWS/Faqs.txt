1. RDS: A read replica can be promoted to a master.
        You can have reserved RDS instances.
2. SNS: Can send push Noifications to IOS/Android.
3. A SWF workflow and task can last for 1 year.
4. PORT SCANNING on EC2 machines is disabled and requires AWS permissions to do so.
5. Elastic IP can be used in one specific VPC only.
6. Reserved Instances can be migrated from one AZ to another.
7. SWF workflow can include tasks to be performed by on-premise servers and humans.
8. HSM appliance should be located near EC2 machines to reduce cost. 


CloudFront:
1. Cloudfront caches each object for 24 hours in case no TTl is supplied in headers. The minimum expiration time in 0 sec.
2. Cloudfront: The transfer from Edge location to client begins as soon as first byte is received from origin server or Regional Caches.
3. S3 origin does not support Regional Edge caches. They are supported only for custom origins like: HTTp server.
4. Only GET Requests are cached and served by edge locations. PUT/POST/PATCH/OPTIONS/DELETE etc are served directly via origin servers.
5. 

2. Can EBS volumes be transferred to different AZ and Region?
    - EBS volumes are specific to a availability zone. i.e an EBS volume existing in availability zone A can only be assigned to 
      a EC2 instance residing on the same availability zone.
      In case, you want to assign the EBS volume to an EC2 running in different AZ, you first need to create a 
      snapshot of the EBS volume. Then from that snapshot you need to create a new EBS volume which resides in the required AZ.

      Incase, you want to assign the EBS volume to an EC2 residing in entirely different region.
      You need to create a snapshot of the EBS volume, then the snapshot can be copied to the required region.
      Then from that snapshot you need to create a new EBS volume and assign it to the required EC2.

3. What is origin Access Identity?
    - A special user assiged to Cloudfront that has access to S3 objects.

4. Do we need to explicitely attach IGW to vpc or simply setting route to IGW is fine.
    - YES. This is absolutely necessary. Simply setting the route to IGW will send all data to BLACKHOLE, if the IGW is not
    attached to a VPC.   

5. Can a EBS volume be detached from one running EC2 instance and attached to another.
   - NO. If its a root volume of the EC2 instance it cannot be detached.
   - YES. If its not a root volume for the EC2 instance.

6. Can Reserved Instances be migrated to different Region?
   - NO.Reserved instances can be moved between availability zones of same region. But, they cannot be moved to other Region.

7. Can we modify Instance Type of Reserved Instance?
   - YES. Convertible Reserved Instances allow you to modify instance type of the Reserved Instances.

9. Difference b/w EC2 termination and EC2 Stop.
    - These 2 features are very very similar to each other, with only certain notable differences.
       - EC2 Stop option is only available for instances whihc have EBS volume as its root volume.
       - Stopping an EC2 does not delete the EBS volumes attached to the instance. However, termination provides this option.
    - NOTE that both options completely deletes the virtual machine assigned to you.
             
10. What will happen incase a EMR cluster is terminated?
      - All the provisioned EC2 nodes master/slave for the cluster will be terminated.
      - All the cluster data stored in S3 will be deleted.

11. Do I need to manually terminate the EMR cluster?
     - No. The cluster and all its resources are automatically destroyed once jobs finish processing.
     However, you can choose to not to do so and then you will need to manually terminate cluster.              

12. Do EMR cluster nodes makes use of multi-AZ?
    - No. All the nodes in a cluster is launched in single AZ.

13. Can my EMR recover if master/slave node is down?
   - No. Incase the master node is down, AWS cannot recover it for you. You need to manually restart it.
   - But if only the slave node is down it can automatically fix it.

14. Can I SSH into my EMR nodes?
   - You can SSH into Master node directly. For Slave nodes, you first need to SSH into master and then in Slave.

15. EMR: Can I modify number of Slave Nodes in a Running CLuster?
   - There are two types of slave nodes:
       Core Nodes: These execute JObs as well as store data in HDFS.
       Task Nodes: These only execute jobs.
   - Core Nodes can only be increased. Task Nodes can be increased as well as decreased.
