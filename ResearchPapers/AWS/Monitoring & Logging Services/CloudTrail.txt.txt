Cloud Trail:
---------------------

Cloud trail is a AWS account monitoring service. What it does is it logs all the requests that have been made to AWS resources
through console, CLI or SDK by any user.

Its just like an AUdit log, which can be used to address security issues and see which user has performed what actions.
