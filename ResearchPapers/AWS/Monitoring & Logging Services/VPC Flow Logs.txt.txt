VPC Flow Logs:
----------------------

Flow Logs allow you to capture IP traffic passing from your AWS network.

You can configure Flow Logs to capture traffic only for a specific Network Interface or for a specific subnet or only for a single Network Interface.
You can also configure to capture only accepted traffic, only Rejected traffic or ALL traffic.

Flow logs are not captured as a stream, infact the data is stored in buffer and is fluched to visible logs only at intervals of 10 mins.

Loga shown in Flow logs are made of 5-tuple:
1. Source IP
2. Source Port
3. Dest IP
4 DEST PORT
5 protocol.

Following traffic is not captured by FlowLog:
----------------------------------------------
1. DHCP traffic
2. Traffic between an EC2 and DNS server.
3. Any request for EC2 instance meta-data (by calling 169.254.169.254)
