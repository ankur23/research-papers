CloudWatch:
----------------------

CloudWatch is a monitoring service provided by AWS. It is used to monitor services such as: EC2, ELB, S3.

Cloudwatch provides following metrics:
----------------------------------------

EC2 CPUutilization, EC2 CPUcreditusage, S3 no. of objects, S3 bucket size, ELB Requestcount, ELB unhealthy host count.

Cloudwatch provides two types of metrics:
-----------------------------------------
1. Basic: This is free!!. Metrics are updated at 5 minute period.
2. Detailed: Not Free, Metrics is updated in 1 minute.

Note: Cloudwatch alarms can be created to send alert notifications to SNS.

CloudWatch EC2 Monitoring:
---------------------------------------

Each EC2 instance has a System status Check and a Instance Status Check, both are provided by CloudWatch along with ec2 monitoring.

If either of the status checks gets failed, means thare is a problem with our EC2 instance.

Fixing System status checks:  These checks are out of our control as they get failed due to some harware/network issue at AWS datacenter.However,
we can try our luck by stopping and restarting the EC2 instance, as this will make the EC2 instance to run on a different server and if the problem 
was related to the specific server which was assigned to our EC2 instance it will most probably be resolved.

Fixing Instance Checks: These checks are well in our control and are caused by software misconfiguration. Generally rebooting the system will solve the issue.
 However, if an instance check is failing due to failed system check, you need to resolve the system check first.

For an EC2 instance there are two types of Metrics:
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Harware/Host Related metrics: Such metrics include:
                   CPU utilization
                   Network IO
                   CPU credit usage
                   DISK IO
  Such metrics can be directly provided by CloudWatch.

2. OS level Metrics: Such metrics include:
                     Memory Utilization
                     Disk Swap
                     Disk Space
 Such metrics require 3rd party softwares to be installed on EC2, so that cloudwatch can collect them.
