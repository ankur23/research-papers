1. Cloud benefits:
a:) Availability
     => data is available from everywhere and anytime.
b:) Fault Tolerent
     => incase a failure occurs, data is not lost. 
             &&
     => the application is still functional even though few of its parts are broken. 
c:) Scalability 
     => Automataic increase of instances when load increases.
d:) Elasticity
     => Automatic increase/decrease of instances when load increases/decreases.

Regions and availibity zones:
A region constitutes of one or many availability zones(datacenters).
Availibility zones within same Region generally contains redundant copies of data so as to avoid data loss incase whole 
datacenter is on fire.
So, if a Region R has 3 availability zones A,B,C. Then a file F1 can most probably be found on more than one availibity zone.
