AWS Direct Connect:
-----------------------

AWS direct connect is a service that provides dedicated Network connection b/w your on-premise network and AWS network.
This is done through an authorized Direct Connect Provider (i.e Verizon or other ISP's)

It is similar to VPN except that in VPN the data needs to travel through several 3rd party routers and in direct connect andedicated
transfer line is provided.
Fig:1:00

The Dedicated line provided by Direct connect Partner will be for a specific Region and can be used with only
that particular region. However, if there are multiple VPC's within that region, all of them can make use of the dedicated line.


Direct Connect benefits:
-------------------------------
1. Reduce Network costs:  Data transferred over Direct connect is billed at lower rate by Amazon.
2. Low Latency and High Consistency: As its a dedicated transfer line.
3. Dedicated private network connection b/w on-premise and AWS network: data does not need to travel over multiple 3rd party routers.

Cross Connect:
------------------------------------
The physical connection b/w the Direct connect partner and your on-premise network.

Private Virtual Interface:
-----------------------------
Using Private virtual interface, communication b/w the on-premise and AWS resources can be done only using 
private IP addresses of the servers as Direct connect is not and INternet Provider. It jus provides a dedicated 
private connection which works like VPN.

For best practice, setup two Direct connect  conections, one for active-active and one for active-failover.
You can also use VPN connections as a backup when Direct connect is not available. 


Public Virtual Interface:
-------------------------------------
A public Virtual Interface, allows you to use Direct connect connection to connect to public endpoints like :
S3 and DynamoDB.
Even though you are accessing public endpoints, connection maintains consistency and low latency as it will use Direct
connect line.
