Virtual Private Network:
---------------------------------------
A virtual private network allows you to extend a subnet from one geographic location to another geographic location
having two seperate Neworks.
Extending the subnet allows the network at location 'A' to communicate internally with all the resources at location 'B'. 
This
is essentially extending the on-premise network to the cloud, or the cloud to the on-premise network.

For AWS, this allows us to communicate with all resources (like an EC2 instance) without the need for 
public IP address and and IGW. It also provides an additional security as the traffic sent using VPN in encrypted.

Virtual Private Gateway(VPG):
------------------------------
A VPG acts as a connector on AWS side of the VPN connection. It is similar to a IGW.

Note:
Only one VPG can be attached to a VPC at any given time.
Both, A VPG and IGW can be attached to a VPC at same time.


Customer Gateway:
------------------
A customer gateway is a hardware device/software application at the on-premise location which acts as a connector 
on on-premise side.
Both VPG and Customer Gateway are required for a VPN connection.

NOTE: In your AWS account, there is a section "Customer gateway". This is where you need to input the public IP
address of the customer gateway installed at on-premise server. SO, that AWS can know where the customer gateway is located.

NOTE: Once the VPG and customer gateway is setup, you need to create a link between the two. This is done from the VPN
Connections link in AWS account.
NOTE: When setting up a VPN, the route table for the subnet (you wish to extend) must include 
new routes which directs traffic of on-premise servers to VPG.
