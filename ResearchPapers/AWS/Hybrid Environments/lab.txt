1. Create two new VPC A nd B.
2. launch one ec2 instance in each of VPC with public IP.
3. Check if we can connect to each ec2 through our terminal.
4. Now, check if we can ping using private IP of instance in one VPC to another instance in seperate VPC.(this should not work)
5. Create VPC peering b/w two VPC.
6. Modify route tables to route VPC A data to VPC A and VPC B data tp VPC B.
7. Now check that step 4 is working or not.
