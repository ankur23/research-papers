VPC Peering:
---------------------------
VPC peering means connecting two VPC networks to each other. So that Resources in VPC A can communicate
with resources in VPC B using private IP addresses.

VPC peering can only occur if both the VPC are in same Region i.e cross region VPC peering is not possible.
However, VPC's residing in two different user accounts can use VPC peering to communicate provided they are in same region.

Transitive VPC peering is not allowed. This means that if a VPC peering is created b/w VPC A and VPC B.
An a seperate VPC peering connection is created b/w VPC B and VPC C. Then dont think that VPC A is connected to VPC C.

if, A==B and B==c, then A!=C

NOTE: Two VPC's can only be peered if they are in same region and have non-overlapping CIDR Block range.
