AWS Lambda:
------------------------

Lambda is a serverless compute platform. This means that in order to execute code you dont need to provision an EC2 instance.
You just need to create a Lambda function and drop your code in it.

Lambda functions are automatically scalable i.e you dont need to worry about the resources needed for your code to execute. Based on the code
requirements AWS will provision the required resources itself.

Lambda's are highly available, fault tolerant, scalable, elastic and cost-efficient.

Payment is calculated based on the time (in milliseconds) consumed by your code to execute. So, if your code takes 1 second to execute i.e 1000 milliseconds, then you pay
for 1000 ms.
For, 10 iterations of your code you will pay for 10 * 1000 = 10000 milliseconds.

Lambda currently supports following languages:
Nodejs
Java 
C#
Python

General Use Cases:
Generally lambda are used to respond to events occurring in AWS, such as:
 - If something is to be done when an object is added to S3 bucket.
 - or, A new dynamodb row is added. etc.
