EC2 Container Service (ECS):
-------------------------

ECS is a container management service provided by AWS. It supports Docker containers.
It allows you to easily create and manage multiple docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances.

Why use ECS or containers?
-------------------------------
It allows for microservice service architecture where each task(microservice) is independently deployable, managable and Scalable.

How it works?
-----------------------------

There is an ECS agent installed on each of EC2 instance within the cluster.
The role of this ECS agent is to start or stop docker container when asked.
 
IMP: Containers are known as tasks in ECS terminology. 

Each Task/container has a definition file associated to it, called as task definition file. 
A task definition file is a JSON formatted file that contains information about how a task/container is to be started. It contains:
 - Which docker image to use.
 - On which repository image is located
 - Which ports will be used by container
 - What data volumes will be used with containers.
