EC2 Storage:
--------------------------------------------

The are two types of storage that can be used with an EC2 instance:
 - Elastic Block Store (EBS)
 - Instance Store

1. Elastic Block Store(EBS): 
-------------------------------

 -> EBS volumes are Network Attached, means they are not physically attached to an EC2 instance but are accessible through Network media.
 -> EBS volumes are PERSISTENT, means they can live beyond the life cycle of the EC2 instance they are attached too. However, you can choose to delete attached
    EBS volume upon EC2 termination.
 -> EBS volumes can easily be detached from one EC2 instance and attached to another. However, One EBS volume cannot be attached to more than one EC2 instance
    at any given time.
 -> You can also create snapshots of an EBS volume. These snapshots can be mounted to other EBS volumes.
 
Note: EBS volumes are the most used volumes in AWS. Most of the instances support only and only EBS volume and no Instance storage.
Note2:Every EC2 instance has a root volume by default, this root volume is also and EBS and not an instance storage.
Note3: At any given time, you can attach as many EBS volumes to an EC2 instance as you wish.

EBS Performance:
-----------------
The performance of EBS volume is measured in IOPS (i.e input/output operations per second).
So, 4 IOPS means, you can perform 4 input/output operations in one second.
However, there is a catch here as placed by AWS, which says one operation cannot be of more than 256KB. So, if you perform 1 input operation of 500KB and 1 output
operation of 400KB. It will be counted as 4 operations instead of being counted as 2 operations. SO BEWARE!!

EBS Initializations:
----------------------
There is no problem with new EBS volumes. However, if a EBS volume is created from a snapshot it requires initialization process. During initialization process
the performace of EBS degrades to about 50%.
The initilaization process occurs when each block from EBS is read for first time. So, instead of directly attaching the EBS to production EC2 first manually read
as many blocks as possible and then attach the EBS volume to production EC2, so that the initialization process gets completed before the volume is attached to 
production EC2.  

Types of EBS volumes:
-----------------------------------
1. General Purpose SSD (GP2): provides 3 IOPS/GB, this means if you chose 8 GB of SSD storage, you can perform 24 IOPS
                              if you chose 100 GB of storage, you can perform 300 IOPS. Dont forget that one operation means 256KB of data.
   Minimum volume size is 1 GB, max volume size is 16TB.

2. Provisioned IOPS SSD: As the name suggests, along with choosing the size of SSD, you can also chose the amount of IOPS you require.
                         So, if you chose 8 GB of SSD storage and chose 500 IOPS. Then you can perform 500 IOPS.
   Minimum voloume size is 4 GB, max volume size is 16 TB.
   Max IOPS that can be set is 20,000 IOPS.

3. Magnetic: This is the cheapest and least performant storage option.
             Min storage size is 1 GB, max is 1 TB.    

EBS optimized instances: There may be cases when a provisioned EBS volume of 400 IOPS, is not able to deliver 400 IOPS. Such case may arise due to bandwidth congestion
------------------------  as EBS is on network and requires available bandwidth to function properly. The solution is to have EBS optimized EC2 instance which has dedicated EBS throughput.
NOTE: AWS provides only certain EC2 instance types with EBS optimization enabled.


2. Instance Store Volumes:
------------------------------------------------

-> These volumes are physically attached to the EC2 instance.
-> The data on the volume is considered as ephemeral. i.e the data is lost when the EC2 is terminated or shutdown.
   However, data survives the reboots.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EBS SNAPSHOTS:
---------------------
EBS snapshots are point in time backups of a EBS volume that are stored in S3.

EBS snapshots are incremental in nature, i.e each successive snapshot stores only the changes that are made from the previous snaphot. Thus reducing our S3 storage
costs.
Note: Even though the storage is incremental, you can still delete the base snapshot or any other in-middle snapshot and still you will be able to restore data using 
any  of the remaining snapshots.
So, for example if the snapshots were taken in following order: S1 -> S2 -> S3 -> S4 -> S5
and I delete snapshots S1, S3 and S5. Still I will be able to restore data using S2 or S4.

Snapshots should be taken during non-peak hours as it degrades performance of EBS volume during snapshotting process.
