Elastic File System (EFS):
-----------------------------

As the name suggests, it provides a elastic storage option for EC2. i.e the size of storage automatically 
increases and decreases based on usage.

One major advantage that EFS has over EBS volumes is that, EFS can be attached to multiple EC2 machines atthe same point of time. 
Thus, the data stored on 
EFS can be shared with multiple EC2 instances without any problem.

EFS storage can expand upto petabytes with a very low latency and you pay only for the amount of storage you are using. 
Thus, EFS provides a high performant storage option.

EFS can span over all availibity zones within a VPC. 
So, this is a big advantage as Two EC2's placed in different availibilty zones can access same data.wow!

EFS is also accessed via EC2 using network connection like EBS. 
However, EFS needs to be mounted on a folder in EC2 for usage, unlike EBS.
