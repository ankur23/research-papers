Reserved Instances are not physical instances, and they are not even instances, they are just On-Demand instances with billing discount applied to them.
These On-Demand Instances must match certain attributes in order to benefit from the billing discount.

Below figure illustrates the scenario:







You are limited to purchasing 20 Reserved Instances per Availability Zone, per month, plus 20 regional Reserved Instances. 
Therefore, in a region that has three Availability Zones, you can purchase 80 Reserved Instances in total: 20 per Availability Zone (60) plus 20 regional Reserved Instances.

Reserved Instances that are purchased for a specific Availability Zone (zonal Reserved Instances) allow you to launch as many instances that are covered by the zonal Reserved Instances, 
even if this results in your exceeding your On-Demand Instance limit. 

For example, your running On-Demand Instance limit is 20, and you are currently running 18 On-Demand Instances. 
You have five unused zonal Reserved Instances. 
You can launch two On-Demand Instances with any specifications, 
and you can launch five instances that exactly match the specifications of your zonal Reserved Instances; giving you a total of 25 instances.
