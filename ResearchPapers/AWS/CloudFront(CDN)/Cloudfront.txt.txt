Cloudfront:
-----------------

CloudFront is a CDN service provided by AWS. It has servers(Edge locations) distributed all over the world. 
When a request for static content is made, it will first be checked with nearest Edge location and if the content 
is foung it will be returned to user.
If Not, the content will be fetched from another Edge location or from origin and will be delivered to user.

CloudFront can be integrated with Route53. An example could be http://cdn.example.com. 
We could register a recordset to route to Cloudfront
incase cdn.example.com is called.

Its better to create a new object for new version of a file instead of invalidating all the caches for that object. 
As invalidating takes time and has its own cost.

You can decide the caching period of objects.
