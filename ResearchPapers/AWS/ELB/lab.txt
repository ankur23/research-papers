1. Classic ELB.

b. Create a classic load balancer [load balancers also have security groups assigned allow port 80 on it]
c. Setup health checking for our load balancer. [TCP over 80]
d. Donot assign any ec2 instance to it, we will use autoscaling to assign instances. 


2. Autoscaling.
a. Create autoscaling launch configuration
b. Setup bash script in launch configutaion to install http server.
c. Create a security group to be assigned to each EC2 instance upon instantiation.
d. Select the option use load balancer. this will allow for autoscaling group ec2 servers to be serviced by ELB.
e. once the autoscaling instantiate any instance, that instance is visible in EC2 dashboard.

Test the above architecture bt manually terminating an ec2. in this case autoscaling should automatically instantiatea new 
instance to replace terminated one.
