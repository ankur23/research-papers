DynamoDB:
----------------------

DynamoDB is a fully-managed NoSql Solution provided by AWS.
It is Schemaless and uses key-value store.

You need to specify the throughput required and Dynamo DB does the rest.

Being fully managed means:
- Service automatically handles the Scaling and Shrinking of underlying hardware based on needs.
- Service is high- Available and fault-tolerant as the data is synchronized within all Availibity zones of the Region you chose.
