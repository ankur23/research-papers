Relational database service:
-------------------------------------
RDS is a relational database service that is fully managed by AWS. You dont have access to underlying Operating System like in EC2.
However, you can choose the Instance type based on your requirements.

Databases supported by RDS:
------------------------------
MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL server.
AWS AURORA

NOTE: Aurora is a fork of mysql developed by AWS and is fully compatible with mysql. Has better performace and is cheaper too.

Multi-Availibity zone, Secondary server configuration:
-------------------------------------------------------
RDS can be setup with a multi availibility zone configuration. Such that the primary server runs on one avilibility zone and secondary 
server runs on different availibity zone. In such a configuration, whenever Primary server fails Secondary automatically kicks in
to take its place.
NOTE: Secondary server is always on standby and does not server any request till its made Primary.
NOTE: Data Replication is Synchronous in this case.
NOTE: AWS switches the Secondary to primary by modifying the IP associated with DNS record of RDS instance to point to secondary server. So, applications dont need to 
have any change and the switch is made without applications even being noticing


Read-Replicas:
-------------------------------------------------
You can also setup Read-replicas to reduce load from Primary server. 
Data to a Read-Replica can be replicated using Primary or Secondary or Another Read-Replica. Data replication is Asynchronous.
Replication lag can be monitored in CloudWatch metrics.
NOTE: Read replicas can only serve Read Requests

Snapshots:
---------------------------------
You can configure to take automatic snapshots of database at specific intervals.
Snapshots are taken from secondary server. If no secondary is configured they will be taken from Primary.
