2. Check how EBS volumes data can be transferred to different AZ and Region.
    - EBS volumes are specific to a availability zone. i.e an EBS volume existing in availability zone A can only be assigned to 
      a EC2 instance residing on the same availability zone.
      In case, you want to assign the EBS volume to an EC2 running in different AZ, you first need to create a 
      snapshot of the EBS volume. Then from that snapshot you need to create a new EBS volume which resides in the required AZ.

      Incase, you want to assign the EBS volume to an EC2 residing in entirely different region.
      You need to create a snapshot of the EBS volume, then the snapshot can be copied to the required region.
      Then from that snapshot you need to create a new EBS volume and assign it to the required EC2.

3. What is origin Access Identity?
    - Done, check cloudfront section.

4. Do we need to explicitely attach IGW to vpc or simply setting route to IGW is fine.
    - Yes this is absolutely necessary. Simply setting the route to IGW will send all data to BLACKHOLE, if the IGW is not
    attached to a VPC.

5. What is KPL in Kinesis.
    - Done, check kinesis section.
6. Check all the limits applicable on Resources.
7. Can I attach multiple Security Group to one EC2.

8. Try to detach Ebs volume from one EC2 and attach it to another.
    - Root volumes cannot be detached from running EC2 machines.
    - Other EBS volumes can be detached and attached to other EC2 in same AZ.

9. Difference b/w EC2 termination n Shutdown.

10. Can Reserved Instances be migrated to different Region?
