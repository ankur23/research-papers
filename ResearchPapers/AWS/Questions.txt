7. Can I attach multiple Security Group to one EC2.
   YES.

8. does it delete only root EBS on termination or all associated EBS?
  ONLY Root EBS volume is deleted by default. By default no other volumes are deleted.

9. EC2: Revisit difference b/w shutdown, stop and terminate, reboot?
   - Shutdown is only an intermediate step to which instance is migrated before being finally Stopped, Terminated or Rebooted.
   - Rebooting an instance is just like OS reboot. It does not decommisions the whole of virtual machine thus, 
     Ip addresses and physical host remains same.
   - Stopping an instance decommissions whole of virtual machine.Thus upon starting again the instance can be 
     given another IP and host machine.
     However, intanceID remains same.
   - Termination is the baap of all and everything is decommissioned in this process.
