(Elastic Map Reduce) EMR:
------------------------------
Fig: 00:34

EMR is a Big data solution provided by AWS. By default it uses Hadoop framework but can be changed to use any of the following frameworks:
Apache Spark
HBase
Presto
Flink

EMR is just a fleet of EC2 instances and we have access to underlying Operating system i.e this service is not
fully managed by AWS.

EMR Workflow:
-------------------
1. data stored in S3, Redshift, Dynamo, RDS is passed to EMR.
2. This data is Mapped to cluster of Master/S;ave nodes for processing.
3. Now this mapped data is processed using computations defined by your custom code logic.
4. This processed data is reduced to single output, which is returned back.

EMR components:
-------------------
1. Master Node:
    - This is the node responsible for distribution of data and tasks to Slave nodes.
    - It tracks the status of tasks given to slave nodes.
    - Monitors health of cluster.
2. Slave Nodes:
    - Executes the given tasks and store data in Hadoop Distributed File system (HDFS).
