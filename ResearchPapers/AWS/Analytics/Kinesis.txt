Kinesis:
--------------------

Fig: 00:31

Kinesis is a realtime data processing service, that can continuosly capture large amounts of data
from multiple sources and can power real-time streaming Dashboards.

The data from the Kinesis can be passed to other AWS services as well, like:
EMR
S3
Redshift
Lamdba
Custom Application.

Note: Data is passed to multiple of these services simultaneously, i.e both EMT and S3 can be working on same data at the same time.




Kinesis is composed of following components:
---------------------------------------------
Stream:
  - This is the tunnel to which data is posted and from which data is retrieved.
  - Data is kept in stream for upto 24 hours by default, this can be extended to upto 7 days.
Producers: 
  - These are devices that collect data to be passed on to kinesis stream.
  - Sample Producers can be IOT sensors, Mobile Devices etc.
  - You can have thousands of producers for a Kinesis Stream.
Consumers
  - These are the applications/ services that consume data from stream.
  - Multiple consumers can consume same data at same time.
  - Sample consumers can be S3, Redshift, EMR, custom application etc.
Shards (processing power):
  - This is the processing power required by Kinesis cluster.
  - More data you want to process, more shards you need to add.
  - Each shard can process 2MB of readData/second and 1MB of write data/second.  

Sample Usages of Kinesis:
----------------------------
1. Gaming: Collect Player actions and feed them into Gaming application to provide more user specific challenges.
2. Analytics: Collect Realtime data from IOT sensors and build predictions.
3. Application Alerts:  Put Real time appliction logs in Kinesis and build an appication to check if everything is working fine as per logs.
