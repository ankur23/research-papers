Kinesis:
--------------------

Fig: 00:31

Kinesis is a realtime data processing service, that can continuosly capture large amounts of data
from multiple sources and can power real-time streaming Dashboards.

The data from the Kinesis can be passed to other AWS services as well, like:
EMR
S3
Redshift
Lamdba
Custom Application.

Note: Data is passed to multiple of these services simultaneously, i.e both EMT and S3 can be working on same data at the same time.


Kinesis is composed of following components:
---------------------------------------------
Stream:
  - This is the tunnel to which data is posted and from which data is retrieved.
  - Data is kept in stream for upto 24 hours by default, this can be extended to upto 7 days.
Producers: 
  - These are devices that collect data to be passed on to kinesis stream.
  - Sample Producers can be IOT sensors, Mobile Devices etc.
  - You can have thousands of producers for a Kinesis Stream.
Consumers
  - These are the applications/ services that consume data from stream.
  - Multiple consumers can consume same data at same time.
  - Sample consumers can be S3, Redshift, EMR, custom application etc.
Shards (processing power):
  - This is the processing power required by Kinesis cluster.
  - More data you want to process, more shards you need to add.
  - Each shard can process 2MB of readData/second and 1MB of write data/second.
Partition Keys:
   - partition keys decide to which shard data block needs to be routed.
   - Partition key is supplied by producers along with data.
Sequence numbers:
   - Each data block is assigned a sequence number to uniquely identify it.
   - This is assigned by Kinesis stream.       

Sample Usages of Kinesis:
----------------------------
1. Gaming: Collect Player actions and feed them into Gaming application to provide more user specific challenges.
2. Analytics: Collect Realtime data from IOT sensors and build predictions.
3. Application Alerts:  Put Real time appliction logs in Kinesis and build an appication to check if everything is working fine as per logs.

Kinesis vs SQS:
-----------------
Kinesis and SQS both are very similar to each other but share some important differences.
- Kinesis maintains ordering of records, this feature is supported only by FIFO SQS.
- Kinesis provides a way for multiple applications to consume same data and in same order.
- Kinesis is better option than SQS when aggregation task is to be performed on data. 

Kinesis Agent:
---------------
Kinesis Agent is something like datadog agent. You can install it on linux sever and it will act as a producer to send data to kinesis stream.

Kinesis Producer Library(KPL) & Kinesis Client Library(KCL):
--------------------------------------------------------------
KPL is the SDK used by producers to post data to kinesis stream.
KCL is the SDL used by consumers to consume data from kinesis stream.

Resharding:
--------------
Resharding is the process of increasing or decreasing the number of shards.
Also, known as shard split and shard merge operations.


Faqs:
-------
1. Data streams synchronously replicates data across 3 availability zones.
2. Max datablock size is 1MB.
3. A single shard can support only 1000 PUT requests/second.
4. A single shard can process 2MB of readData/second and 1MB of write data/second.
5. Max. of 10 shards are allowed per region.
