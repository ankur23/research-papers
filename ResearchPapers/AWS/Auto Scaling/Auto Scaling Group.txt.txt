Auto Scaling Group:
---------------------------

Auto scaling is a feature provided by AWS that automates the process of increasing/decreasing number 
of EC2 instances available for an application.

Autoscaling is done based on the cloudwatch metrics.

Autoscaling needs two type of configuartions:

1. Launch Configuration:  The configuration template that will be used when launching a new EC2 instance. It contains 
   ---------------------   information about AMI, instance type, user-data, storage, security groups etc.

2. Group Configurations:  VPC and Availibility zones in which new instance is to be launched.
   --------------------   Min-Max allowed instances
                          Cloudwatch criterias to trigger instantiation of new instance or termination of a instance.
