VPN (virtual private network):
A vpn extends a private network across public network.
What this means is that, a user on the public netwok can connect to a private network using a secured encrypted tunnel, giving an impression that the user is part of the private network. 
For VPN to work a VPN server needs to be setup in the Private network, which can perform all above stated duties.
VPN works on OS level, so its easy to configure OS so that all the running applications go through VPN tunnel.
This can be a way to access face book in countries which do not allow it.

An IPv4 address:

An IPv4 address consists of 32 bits.
8bits(255) . 8bits(255) . 8bits(255) . 8 bits(255)

Any IP address consists of 2 logical portions:
a:) Network Prefix or Routing prefix
b:) Host Identifier or Rest of the bits.

Evolution of IP4 address:

In the very initial days of internet, the first 8 bits were reserved as a Network prefix and the rest 24 bits were used as a host identifier.
The problem of this architecture was that, the internet could support only  254 (2^8) independent networks. 
This format was sufficient at a time when only a few large networks existed, such as the ARPANET but soon it became clear
that this would not be enough in near future.


To bypass the limitation of above architecture classful addressing scheme was introduced.
The solution was to increase the number of bits representing network prefix so that more networks can be created, each potentially having fewer hosts. 
A challenge for classful scheme was to provide backward compatibility with the existing networks.
Since all existing network numbers at the time were smaller than 64, Which means they had only used the 6 (00111111) least-significant bits of the network number field out of 8.  
Hence, it was possible to use the most-significant bits to introduce a set of classes, where all existsing networks lie in the same class, thus
being backward compatible.

The address space was divided into 5 classes, A,B,C,D,E. Out of these classes only 3 are significant ones(A,B,C). Class D is reserved for multicast
and Class E is reserved for future usage.
All the existing network of that time was assigned to class A.

Following is the class distribution:
Take table from here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network


In the following table:

    n indicates a bit used for the network ID.
    H indicates a bit used for the host ID.

Class A
  0.  0.  0.  0 = 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000
127.255.255.255 = 01111111.11111111.11111111.11111111
                  0nnnnnnn.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH

Class B
128.  0.  0.  0 = 10000000.00000000.00000000.00000000
191.255.255.255 = 10111111.11111111.11111111.11111111
                  10nnnnnn.nnnnnnnn.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH

Class C
192.  0.  0.  0 = 11000000.00000000.00000000.00000000
223.255.255.255 = 11011111.11111111.11111111.11111111
                  110nnnnn.nnnnnnnn.nnnnnnnn.HHHHHHHH


This architecture change extended the addressing capability in the Internet, but did not prevent IP address exhaustion.
The problem was that many companies needed larger number of host addresses than a Class C network provided (254 hosts).
and therefore they received a Class B block, which was in most cases much larger than required (2^16 = 65536 hosts).  
The pool of unassigned Class B addresses (2^14, or about 16,000) was rapidly being depleted.Thus,
Classful networking was replaced by Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), starting in 1993.

The CIDR, removed the fixed boundaries over the Network prefix, 
it suggested that the Network prefix will be of a variable length and the remaining length bits will be used as HOST identifier.
Now, since the network length was not predefined and restricted via classes as in classful routing, a way was needed to identify the
number of bits that constitutes for Network prefix in a classless architecture.
Such a notation came to be known as CIDR notation. In CIDR noation number of bits representing network prefix are added after / as suffix 
to IP address.
ex: 192.168.2.0/24
    NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.HHHHHHHH

Network mask: A network mask is a 32 bit field like IP address, which when performed bitwise AND on the Ip address of a network
yields the network prefix.

ex: 192.168.2.13/24
    NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.HHHHHHHH
    11000000.10101000.00000010.00001101 (ip address)
      (192)    (168)    (2)       (13)

                   +
    11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 (network mask)
       (255)    (255)   (255)    (0)
----------------------------------------------------------------
    11000000.10101000.00000010.00000000 (network prefix) 
    00000000.00000000.00000000.00001101 (host identifier)
      

Subnets:  A subnet can be created from a network by using some of the most significant Bits from HOST identifier and grouping them
with network mask to create subnet mask.This divides a network into smaller subnets.
              Pick picture from here:
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork

The following diagram modifies the example by moving 2 bits from the host part to the subnet mask to form four smaller subnets one quarter the previous size:


192.168.5.130   11000000.10101000.00000101.10000010   (ip address)

255.255.255.192 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000    (subnet mask)

192.168.5.128   11000000.10101000.00000101.10000000    (network/routing prefix)

0.0.0.2         00000000.00000000.00000000.00000010    (host part)

Based on the network prefix, routers decide which traffic packet belongs to different subnet and needs to be sent outside and which traffic 
packet belongs to local subnet and can be routed directly.
