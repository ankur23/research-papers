Union FIle system:

As the name says, it provides a unified view of several different filesystems or directories within the same filesystem.
Each physical directory is called a branch.

Each branch is assigned a priority, a branch with higher priority overrides the branch with lower priority.

consider the following ex:
Branch 1:
/vegetables
     -Tomato
     -Potato
Branch 2:
/Fruits
    - Apple
    - Tomato

Mounting these two branches on a directory /veg-fruit, will result in following.

/veg-fruit
   - Apple      (from branch2)
   - Tomato     (from branch1) 
   - Potato     (from branch1)

The file Tomato from branch1 overrides tomato from branch2, this is because branch1 has more priority than branch2.
NOTE: By default, the branch that is mounted 1st has more priority.

 
like any other filesystem, Unionfs is mounted. Unlike other filesystems, Unionfs does not mount on top of a device; it mounts on top of directories that are specified as a mount-time option. To create a union, we mount Unionfs as follows: 

`# mount -t unionfs -o dirs=/Fruits:/Vegetables \
> none /mnt/healthy`


 This process is recursive. If there were a subdirectory of Fruits named Green that contained a file named Lime and a subdirectory of Vegetables also named Green that contained a file named Lettuce, the result would be:

$ ls /mnt/healthy
Apple Carrots Green/ Tomato
$ ls /mnt/healthy/Green
Lime Lettuce


Overlayfs allows one, usually read-write, directory tree to be overlaid onto another, read-only directory tree. All modifications go to the upper, writable layer. This type of mechanism is most often used for live CDs but there's a wide variety of other uses.


 With a simple modification, we also can use an overlay mount. That is, we can replace /home/cpw/ linux with the unified view:


# mount -t unionfs -o
> dirs=/home/cpw/linux:/usr/src/linux=ro
> none /home/cpw/linux


Example usage of union file systems:
Live CDs => where users can have experience of whole OS even through CDs are read only. 
Harddisk filesystem is overlayed over CDROM, so that when a user writes to running live cd, entries are copied to HDD fs instead.
This is called copy on write.
