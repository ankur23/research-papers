Answers:
accept(), recv() are blocking calls. However, send is not a blocking call.    






1. Tr to implement a single process scoket server with blocking IO and present the problem encountered.
2. Do the above with NON-Blocking IO model using single process. present the problems with this approach.
3. Do the above with blocking IO with multi process server. Present the problems with this approach.
