BFS:
——————

BFS is an algorithm for searching and traversing tree and graphs.

It works by exploring neighbour nodes of the start node followed by neighbours of neighbour nodes and so on . . . till no more nodes can be visited.

BFS can also be used to find shortest path from a source to destination for unweighted graphs or graphs which have same weight for all edges.

BFS makes use of QUEUE to keep track of neighbours of a node.
A MAP is used to keep track of the VISITED nodes.
